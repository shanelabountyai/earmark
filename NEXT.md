# NEXT — Earmark

## ▶ Now: Phase 2 PR open on `phase-2` → `main` ("Earmark Phase 2: persistence, RLS enforce, guests"). Shane reviews and merges.

## ▶ Next session: Phase 3, approvals and money UI (PRD §7). Model: Opus (money and approvals are correctness-critical).

Builds on Phase 2's actions in `src/earmark/actions.ts`. Gate: e2e demo steps 1–8 pass.

**Phase 3 inherits (D-17):**
- Planning CRUD (fiscal year, programs, campaigns, lines, planned edits with the replan marker)
- Seat management
- The reallocation flow (`Reallocation` table exists; the `reallocation` chain is in the rules)
- Publishing a variance note
- Invoice approve-for-payment (emits `invoice.approved_for_payment`)
- Binding a guest's agency at invite time: core invite accept is template-owned, so either an `assignGuestAgency` step after accept, or a template hook proposed upstream
- `seed:demo` for Northwind, Contoso, Meridian and Dana (PRD §9)

**Open items, not blocking:**
- `FOUNDATION_PATCHES.md` holds two lines for the `guest` role (D-12). Propose upstream as template v1.7.0 (`guest` role, no core permission), then delete the patch lines when Earmark merges it.
- The template's migrations still create the `billing` and `notifications` tables (`BillingAccount`, `Outbox`, `StripeEvent`) though both modules are removed here. `prisma migrate diff` wants to drop them. Left alone: a template-side question, not Earmark's.
- The tag `v1.6.1` was never pushed to this repo (only `v1.6.0`), so `foundation:drift` fails on a fresh clone until it is fetched. Fix: `git fetch https://github.com/shanelabountyai/saas-foundation.git tag v1.6.1 --no-tags && git push origin v1.6.1`.
- **Template bug (fix in the next template patch):** the v1.6.0 `ci.yml` enforce step hardcodes `saas_foundation_test`, and `new-project` only renames it at clone time. Every clone that merged v1.6.x and later sets `RLS_ENFORCE=1` gets a red `ci (enforce)` at setup. Earmark fixed its own copy (`d1db748`). The template should use `$PGDATABASE` or the DB name from `DATABASE_URL`.
- GitHub's default branch is `prd` (holds only the PRD commit); work merges to `main`. Consider making `main` the default.

**Local setup notes:** `npm run db:setup`, then in `.env.local` and `.env.test` set `DATABASE_URL` to the `DATABASE_URL_APP_RW` value and `RLS_MODE=enforce` (D-08; README).
